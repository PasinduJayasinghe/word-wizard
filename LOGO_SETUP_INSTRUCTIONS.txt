HOW TO ADD THE WORD WIZARD LOGO:

1. Save the logo image you provided as "logo_wordwizard.png"

2. In Android Studio, navigate to:
   app/src/main/res/drawable/

3. Right-click on the "drawable" folder → Open In → Explorer/Finder

4. Copy and paste your "logo_wordwizard.png" file into this folder

5. Return to Android Studio - the logo will appear automatically

That's it! The code is already configured to use this logo.

Alternative: If you prefer different formats:
- PNG recommended (transparent background works best)
- Can also use JPG, but PNG is better for logos
- File name: logo_wordwizard.png (exactly as shown)

The onboarding screen will automatically display this logo!
